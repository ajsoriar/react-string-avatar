/**
 * react-string-avatar
 * React String Avatar is a simple React component that generates a letter's avatar like Microsoft or Google do in their web apps. First letter of each word in a string or a group of initials will be used to generate the avatar. The image of the avatar will be rendered in an html img tag as a real png or jpeg. The image data can be retrieved using javascript to be stored in back-end giving you an initial profile picture in your web or mobile apps when the user does not upload one. Several React props are available to configure the output: size, shape, resolution, colors, etc.
